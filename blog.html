              <b>Scope of var:</b><br />If a var variable is declared inside a
              function, it's visible and usable anywhere within that function.
              If a var variable is declared outside any function , it becomes a
              global variable, meaning it's visible and usable anywhere in your
              entire JavaScript code, which can sometimes lead to unintended
              interactions and bugs.var variables can be re-declared and
              updated.var variables are hoisted to the top of their scope and
              initialized with a value of undefined.
            </li>

            <li class="my-4">
              <b>Scope of let:</b><br />A variable declared in a block with let
              is only available for use within that block.a variable declared
              with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var, a let
              variable cannot be re-declared within its scope. Just like var,
              let declarations are hoisted to the top. Unlike var which is
              initialized as undefined, the let keyword is not initialized. So
              if you try to use a let variable before declaration, you'll get a
              Reference Error.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Scope of const:</b><br />Variables declared with the const
              maintain constant values. const declarations share some
              similarities with let declarations.Like let declarations, const
              declarations can only be accessed within the block they were
              declared.const cannot be updated or re-declared.This means that
              the value of a variable declared with const remains the same
              within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared.Every const
              declaration, therefore, must be initialized at the time of
              declaration.Just like let, const declarations are hoisted to the
              top but are not initialized.

            <b>Main Differences:</b><br />
            <ol class="list-disc pl-4">
                <li>
                    Var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let
                    and const are block scoped.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let
                    variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can
                    neither be updated nor re-declared.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var
                    variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables
                    are not initialized.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const
                    must be initialized during declaration.
